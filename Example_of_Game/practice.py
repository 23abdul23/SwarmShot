# Use V S Code ( no problem if other editor)

# Issue 2: 
# Just create a Window in Python of any size (say 800 by 600 pixels)
# So this is total black screen.
# 
# Note : While referring to any file use 'copy relative path' ,Path relative to main repo.
# ex. 'Sprites\Sprites_Player\Char_003.png'
# In python \m is taken as escape sequence 
# Hence any path should be like Sprites/Sprites_Player   and not like Sprites\Sprites_Player.
# Hence after copying relative path , just change \ to / 
#  
#  Use the tiles in Sprites/Sprites_Environment and create the map.
# (Using Single tile , will give a boring map ) 
# (Use multiple tiles ,so that beautiful map is created )
# 
# Write code below this :
